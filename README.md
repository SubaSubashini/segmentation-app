<head>🧩 Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning</head>

<h1>📘 Overview<h1></h1>

This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning techniques to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.
By analyzing customer data, the goal is to help businesses make data-driven marketing decisions, improve customer retention, and design personalized marketing strategies.

🎯 Objective

<li>The main objective of this project is to:

Understand customer patterns and behaviors.

Segment customers into meaningful groups using clustering algorithms.

Provide insights for targeted marketing strategies and decision-making.</li>


<h1>🧠 Machine Learning Techniques</h1>

Algorithm Used: K-Means Clustering

Alternative Models Tested: Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN

Feature Scaling: StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler

Dimensionality Reduction (Optional): PCA for visualization


🧰 Tools & Technologies

<li>Programming Language	Python
Libraries	Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
IDE/Notebook	Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Visualization	Power BI / Tableau (Optional)
Version Control	Git, GitHub</li>>



🧾 Dataset

Dataset Name: Mall Customers Dataset (or your dataset name)

Source: Kaggle / Company Database / Open Data Repository


<h3>Attributes:<h3>

Customer ID

Gender

Age

Annual Income

Spending Score


<h3>⚙️ Project Workflow</h3>

1. Data Collection – Load and explore dataset.


2. Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant features.


3. Data Visualization – Explore distributions, correlations, and patterns.


4. Feature Selection – Select key features for segmentation.


5. Model Building – Apply K-Means / Hierarchical clustering.


6. Cluster Analysis – Identify and label distinct customer groups.


7. Visualization – Display clusters using 2D/3D scatter plots or PCA.


8. Insights & Interpretation – Summarize findings for business use.



📊 Results & Insights

<li>Identified 4 distinct customer segments based on income and spending behavior.

Business can:

Focus marketing campaigns on high-value customers.

Offer discounts to price-sensitive customers.

Improve engagement among moderate spenders.</li>
